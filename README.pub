The repository contains a jupyter notebook for both datasets I chose (They are named Football.ipynb 
and Phising websites.ipynb). 

To be run, these notebooks can be opened with Jupyter Notebook, and then each cell
can be run individualy. I advise to run the cells in order to avoid any problem of undefined variables.
